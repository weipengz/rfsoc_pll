/*
 * ZCU111/ZCU216 mux switch has basically the same configuration (pg. 56 zcu111
 * user guide and pg.3 of clk104 schematic) I0A is one LMX for the ADC, I1A is
 * the LMX for the DAC, I2A is the LMK, the only difference is that zcu216 does
 * not have a second RF ADC LMX PLL, the ZCU111 does, this is I3A for teh ZCU111
 * but the ZCU216 is not connected
 *
 * The HTG board is (check, this was off the top of my head) I0A tile ADC
 * 224/225 LMX, I1A is ADC 226/227, I2A is DAC first two tiles, I3A is second
 * two tiles.
 *
 * It may be possible to define a 'rf pll clocking' struct of sorts similar to
 * i2c that solves this but with setting via i2c and gpio different between
 * zcu216 makes implementation tricky
 *
 * The mux is only used for readback though, so not super critical unless
 * debugging became important
 *
 * htg and zcu111 use hardware gpio expanders (IOX) as to toggle the mux,
 * zcu216/208 use a fabric controlled gpio
